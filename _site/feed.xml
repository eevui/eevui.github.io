<p>She prints out and compiles these materials for the students to take as handouts.
And my mother has to typeset the materials for printing.</p>

<p>As most people do, my mother typically typesets her documents in Microsoft Word.
Being a WYSIWYG document editor, typesetting should be painless.
Right?</p>

<p>Apparently not!</p>

<p>And to be fair, Microsoft Word does a good job at what it does.
Simple documents are easy to typeset.
However, it falls apart too easily at just a little bit of complexity.</p>

<p>Here are, quite literally, a couple of pain points that I’ve had with my limited time using Word.</p>

<h3 id="poor-list-spacing-experience">Poor list spacing experience</h3>

<p>Word’s automatic bulleting and numbering is a pain.</p>

<p>Entering a numbered item like “1.” automatically begins a numbered list.
This adopts Word’s default numbering spacing and shifts the entire line you’re on.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the automatic spacing doesn’t work with the rest of the document visually.
This requires small manual adjustments to the list item spacing, which can be tweaked using the indent markers found on the ruler.</p>

<p>And speaking of the indent markers, I always have trouble distinguishing between the three.
What does the top triangle mean again?
The bottom triangle?
The flat bar?
I end up fiddling with all three anyway—always failing to get the right amount of spacing I want.</p>

<p>I find that adjusting the indent markers doesn’t always line up the list items.
Especially when it’s a document that I didn’t type up.
Items like to jump around and skip the desired visual spacing—a symptom of poor document structure.</p>

<h3 id="encourages-poor-document-structure">Encourages poor document structure</h3>

<p>Word makes it easy to structure documents poorly.</p>

<p>To get words to a desired position, most people repeatedly hit the <em>Spacebar</em> or <em>Enter</em> key to insert <em>whitespace</em> characters.
Visually, this accomplishes what they want.
But this is poor and fragile typesetting.</p>

<p>Why?
Because Word <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> resize whitespace characters as it wants.
Thus changes to preceding content or spacing can result in broken typesetting.
But to be fair, that’s the type of whitespace character the <em>Space</em> key enters: a breaking space<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I believe that, ideally, a document should be structured according to its content, not according to its style.</p>

<p>However, what ends up happening is that people end up stressing over how their document looks.
My mother should be focusing on what quiz items she wants, not how it looks!</p>

<h3 id="stiff-tables">Stiff tables</h3>

<p>In wanting to achieve a layout without using fragile whitespaces,  I am reminded of early HTML.</p>

<p>In pre-CSS HTML, tables used to be the way to go for layouting webpages in a grid.
Grid layouting allows text to be typeset relatively aesthetically.
It should follow, then, that tables are also a great tool to typeset word documents relatively aesthetically too.</p>

<p>In my quest to avoid using whitespace characters for typesetting, I gravitate toward inserting tables instead.
Tables avoid having to use whitespace characters, which is great.
And they also size the table columns equally by default.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft Word’s tables also happen to be a pain to use.
For me, that is.</p>

<p>I don’t know if it’s just me being not familiar with Word, but it felt like far too many clicks to adjust basic properties of a table.
Adjusting for consistent cell sizing in the table involves a setting buried deep in menu options and takes multiple clicks.
At the same time, having to guess which tab menu it could be in.</p>

<p>Table positioning is a fuss too.
Somehow typsetting a plain table is difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>One would think that dragging the table would work, but it often doesn’t.
Finding an anchor on the table to drag from is a chore in itself.
And resizing the table using the mouse also doesn’t work reliably.
Resizing the table snaps dimensions to fixed points.
And until now, I still haven’t figured out how to properly work with tables to do what I want it to do.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-use-then">What do you use then?</h3>

<p>To be fair, I don’t use Word a lot.
So what do I use?</p>

<p>It’s not perfect either, but I prefer writing my documents in plaintext or Markdown.
Writing in plaintext places the highlight on the content of the document, over how it looks.</p>

<p>In particular, I use the wonderful <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to convert between Markdown and different formats.
I can write a simple and plain text file on my computer, pass it through Pandoc, and get a beatifully typeset document at the end.
Pandoc can even convert that same plain text document to HTML, DOCX, or even PPTX slides.</p>

<p>Pandoc takes a bit to get used to and customize, but perhaps I’ll write about how I use Pandoc more next time.</p>

To start writing.
This is my soft-commitment to adopting the <em>Year of Writing</em> as my yearly theme.</p>

<h3 id="yearly-themes">Yearly themes?</h3>

<p>The concept of <em>yearly themes</em> is something I got from the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/">Cortex</a> podcast hosted by CGP Grey and Myke Hurley.
There they describe a <a href="https://www.themesystem.com/">theme system</a> wherein you set for yourself a theme to guide your decisions throughout the year (or period).
And instead of setting new year’s resolutions, which often fail in the first few weeks of the year, a yearly theme is set.
This theme then acts as a guide for the direction of your personal or professional growth for the period.</p>

<p>The advantage the theme system has over standard yearly goals is that failure is less demoralizing.</p>

<p>If you set a goal of losing 20 kilos this year, should it be a failure if you only got to lose 15 kilos by the end of the year?
Maybe it shouldn’t.
You made decisions and spent willpower to lose those 15 kilos, and that shouldn’t be considered a failure!</p>

<p>Instead of setting goals that can fail, consider setting a <em>yearly theme</em>.
A good example would be a theme like the <em>Year of Health</em>.
In this <em>Year of Health</em>, you can make conscious decisions to have a healthier diet, to exercise regularly, and to sleep better.
Basically gravitating toward any activity that would be generally considered <em>healthy</em>.</p>

<p>When faced with the enticing option of ordering in some fast food, let the <em>Year of Health</em> dissuade you and guide you to healthier eats.
When you’re stuck at home sitting all day, let the <em>Year of Health</em> push you towards perhaps taking up a sport or to move around a bit more.
And when you waste time swiping on the black rectangle while in bed, let the <em>Year of Health</em> remind you to set boundaries and time limits so that you can get to sleep earlier.
All this with the goal of getting healthy, with a side benefit of losing weight.</p>

<h3 id="so-why-the-year-of-writing">So why the <em>Year of Writing</em>?</h3>

<p>Recently, I’ve been reading a lot more Hacker News, which often links to a lot of blogs.
And a <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/">couple</a> of <a href="https://candrewlee14.github.io/blog/i-will-write-more/">these</a> <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/11/08/writing.html">blogs</a> that I read were on the merits of writing.
I wanted to improve myself and reap these benefits; so here I am now, I’m writing.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a bit wishy-washy about my thoughts and decisions, unable to defend and justify my decisions.
Both from other people and myself.
So I want to start writing, to straighten out my thoughts and to put them in order.
To be more deliberate with my thoughts and decisions.
And to be able to make proper, well justified decisions in my life.</p>

<p>Another reason is that I want to document what I learn.
Writing a blog post on something that I’ve learned can serve as a reference for myself in the future.
And as an added bonus, it could serve as a reference for other people to stumble upon as well.
Not that I expect other to people to read my blog anyway, but who knows?</p>

<p>Writing a blog also affords me a chance to exhibit grasp of a topic I’m learning.
It is said that you’ve sufficiently learned something when you are able to convey that knowledge to others.
So when I am able to write out a blog post and transfer knowledge on the topic, I can be assured that I’ve actually learned.
And since I am currently an instructor in college, honing this skill of knowledge transfer is important to me.</p>

<p>Finally, I simply want to improve my writing.
To communicate better and to write sentences better.
I feel more comfortable writing since I can editorialize what I say, and maybe that’s why I’m more quiet in person.
I can have the time to think about what to say in text, before I hit send.
And to lean into that, improving my writing would (I hope) improve my overall communication skills.</p>

<p>Thus, in an effort to grow as an individual and professionally: the <em>Year of Writing</em>.</p>

<h3 id="fingers-crossed">Fingers crossed.</h3>

<p>I hope this isn’t a one-off blog post, like I’ve done in the past.
But here’s to more blog posts in the future!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This year, I want to start a blog. To start writing. This is my soft-commitment to adopting the Year of Writing as my yearly theme.]]></summary></entry></feed>
